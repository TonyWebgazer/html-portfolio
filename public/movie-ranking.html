<h1>The Best Movies According to Anthony</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Bad Taste</h3>
<p>Great comedy sci-fi film, made by Peter Jackson, before he was famous.
Zero budget, unknown actors, and DIY special effects.</p>
<h3>The Terminator</h3>
<p>One of the greatest 80s sci-fi, full of A.I. paronoia. One of Cameron's, and Arnie's, greatest films.</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>A film about trying to fill the emptiness of a life with no meaning, where zombie consumerism isn't the answer, but neither is the anarchic rejection of modern society.</p>
